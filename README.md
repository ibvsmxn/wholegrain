## D'André Phillips - Front-End Test 

The main building part took about an hour, with 20 minutes spent on quality assurance. 

This was built using VS Code for Mac.


## D'André Phillips - Back-End Test 

I'm sorry, but this was too great of a challenge for me, considering I'm only a front-end developer whose never even altered a WordPress plugin let alone build one.

I spent about an hour on this trying to get my head around the basics, but I think this is something that would take me at least a day let alone 2 hours.
